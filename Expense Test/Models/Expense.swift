// Next check out the Expenses class on line 52.

// This is the class that creates a list of expenses. This may also be a good place to

// and then the app closes or a save button is pushed we can call a function from this class to write the allExpenses list
// to the json file. Just a random idea. :P
// Next check out line 18 in NavigationTabs to see how the environment object works.
