# ExpenseTracker

Expense Tracker is an iOS mobile application written in Swift which functions as a tracking tool for spending habits. 

## Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/bethanyhull/ExpenseTracker.git
```

## Usage

This project requires a machine running an up to date mac OS. First go to the app store and make sure you have the latest version of Xcode installed. Next, clone the repository onto the machine in a folder you have easy access to. Open up Xcode and select "Open a project or file" from the start menu. Once the program opens at the very top left of the Xcode menu bar you will see buttons with a triangle and a square for running and stopping the project. To the direct right of those buttons first select the iPhone 11 pro max for your simulator type. Once this is done click the triangle "run" button and the simulator should open in a seperate window. Depending on your machine this may take a minute or two to get up and running the first time.
